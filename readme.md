# Devvyyxyz Popup

Add a stylish, closable "Made by Devvyyxyz" popup to your website with one line of code.

## Usage

1. Add this line before your closing `</body>` tag:

```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devvyyxyz/devvyyxyz-popup/refs/heads/main/script.js"></script>
```

2. The popup will appear in the bottom right corner.
3. Clicking the popup opens [devvyy.xyz](https://devvyy.xyz) in a new tab.
4. The popup can be closed with the X button.
5. No CSS file is needed; all styles are injected automatically.
6. The logo is loaded from this repo automatically:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devvyyxyz/devvyyxyz-popup/refs/heads/main/logo.png
```

## Customization
- To use a different logo, edit the script or host your own image and update the image URL in the script.
